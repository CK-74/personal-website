    <hr>
    <p>I am a student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, majoring in Software Engineering with a minor in Mathematics and AI.</p>
    <p>I created this minimalist website to show that I am at least good enough to create a website. I also created this website to showcase my projects and skills better.</p>
    <p>Above are three different sections: Resume, Projects, and Contact. Feel free to explore them; my skills will be listed under the Resume section and shown in the Projects section.</p>
    <p>NO AI was used for this website or projects other than basic VS Code autofill, unless stated otherwise. There is a section below created specifically for AI to demonstrate my capabilities.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my personal website, and thank you for your time.</p>
    <h2>AI Section</h2>
    
    <div class="ai-section-buttons">
        <a href="ai_section/index_ai.html" target="_blank" class="about-ai-button">Agent</a>
        <a href="ai_section/gemini.html" target="_blank" class="about-ai-button">Gemini</a>
    </div>
    <p>For the AI section, I didn't spend too much time on it, but I used VS Code's Agent tool to build the more bland 1st website, while I used Google's Gemini to create the 2nd one with more flashy effects. <br>
    I tried not to do much actual coding on these sites, but I occasionally had to fix links manually.
    <br>I created this AI section since it would demonstrate that I know how to use AI.</p>
