    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I'm a University of Nebraska-Lincoln student pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Software Engineering with a minor in Mathematics and AI. I find software development engaging and enjoy working on projects that challenge me. I would like to focus on the use of AI in software development and AI in general as I believe it's the future of technology.
         Although, I enjoy writing both backend and frontend code and enjoy being a well-rounded software developer.</p>

      <p>Right now I'm pursuing internships in software engineering and AI development/use. I'd like to gain experience in both fields to gain real world experience and work on a career in software development.
        <br>I'm also focusing on finishing projects for experience and doing LeetCode/NeetCode problems.
