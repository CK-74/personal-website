    <h3>BurnPlan</h3>
    <p>One of my first projects, BurnPlan, was made with Java and calculates, using real-time weather data, the fire risk based on Tennessee's prescribed burning procedures.</p>

            <li>Worked with a team, assigned tasks, created documentation, and tracked open and closed issues</li>
            <li>Used GitLab</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What I learned</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>More indepth Java programming and testing</li>

    <h3>CryptoApp</h3>
    <p>My second large project, CryptoApp, was made with Python and allows a user to track: past and present crypto prices, set price alerts, and create a portfolio that would track an amount of coins with persistent storage using MySQL.</p>
